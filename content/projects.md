* [Hammer](https://modrinth.com/modpack/hammer) is a simple performance modpack for Forge that tries to keep the game as fast as possible, while still looking great. It is meant to be a sort of "base layer" that you can build on top of to make your own modpacks and instances or just use by itself. It is designed to have the least mods possible, with the best performance possible. No quality-of-life mods, just optimization.

  You can find the project files on [GitHub](https://github.com/skywardmc/hammer) and the builds on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/hammer).

* [Waffle's Optimization](https://modrinth.com/modpack/wafflesoptimization) is a modpack designed to provide a more immersive experience than other modpacks offer, although if you are looking for performance take a look at modpacks like [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) or [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive), this modpack brings most of the features of optifine.
